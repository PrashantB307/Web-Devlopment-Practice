                Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms
                to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.
                IBM has a rich history with machine learning. One of its own, Arthur Samuel, is credited for coining the term, “machine learning” with his 
                research (PDF, 481 KB) (link resides outside IBM) around the game of checkers.

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">
                Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to intelligence of humans and other animals. Example tasks in which this is done include speech recognition, computer vision, 
                translation between (natural) languages, as well as other mappings of inputs.
                AI applicants include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo and Tesla), generative or creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), automated decision-making, and co
                mpeting at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go).[1]

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">
                Natural language processing is the big new trend taking over the internet. While you've most likely seen it in use in Google's autocomplete software, or when your smartphone offers a 
                prediction of what you are trying to type, it is capable of much smarter things.
                ChatGPT is powered by a software known as GPT-3, trained on billions of examples of texts, then taught how to form coherent and logical sentences.
                ChatGPT is an example of AI and its future. It has proven its ability to make completely new websites from scratch, write entire length books
                 and even make jokes... although, it clearly still hasn't mastered humour yet.
